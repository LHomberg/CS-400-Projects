Once upon a time, there was a very annoying child that lived with a family. One day, the family got so annoyed that they gave the child a plane ticket
and threw him out of the home. The child had to wander all on his own to the airport where he borded a flight to Russia. The child decided to become a
russian doctor and went to medical school for 2 years. Due to the lack of safety restrictions, the child became a doctor by the age of eleven.
